The starting version of this project is based on the Expenses app in 
Learning Tree's Course 2771, Android Development, but has some "best
practices" improvements over the version offered in that course. It
is hope that these improvements will work their way into the relevant
exercise versions as time permits.

It also has some settings that are not used in 2771, but these
are probably best ignored.
