<h1>Expenses App</h1>
<p>
The Expenses App is provided by YourCompany.com's HR department to
allow you to conveniently record expenses incurred on company business.
</p>
<p>
There are two main screens, the List and the Edit/Detail page.
On the main list page, the round button in the lower right allows you to enter a new expense item.
Tapping on an item in the main list allows you to edit it.
To remove an item, long-press on it in the list and drag it to the trash can at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
You'd expect an application like this to automatically synchronize your data with the server,
but the HR people cut our funding before we finished developing that.
However you can upload your expenses to the server, using the upload button in the menu.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for using the app. If enough people use it and tell HR they like it,
maybe we'll get funding to implement automatic synchronization.

P.S. Please use the <code>Back</code> button or gesture to return to the main app screen.
