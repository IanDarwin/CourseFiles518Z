The answer version of this is identical to the current source of the bookmarks app,
which is in its own project in your home directory, so we didn't copy it here.
Just open the Bookmarks project to see how we added the popup menu.

Spoiler alert! To get an exact look at the changes, use the CLI, after navigating
into the bookmarks project:

	 git diff ^80a67d ^97812a

== Post-Bonus task

If you did the second bonus, "Add a Drawer", and
if you have a personal GitHub account, 

	* Make a fork of https://github.com/IanDarwin/bookmarks-flutter;
	* Apply the "drawer" changes into your forked bookmarks project;
	* Submit a pull request to add that into the main bookmarks-flutter source.

First or any entry not necessarily accepted - I will decide after the second group
has had a chance to enter.

P.S. If you are looking at the logs, pay no attention the the "synchronzation" stuff
as it will be explained in a later chapter.
