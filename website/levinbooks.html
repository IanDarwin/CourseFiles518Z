<h1>Levin on Android</h1>
<p>
Jonathan Levin has a series of books on the internals of the Android System.
Volume 1 is "Power User's" detailed look at the system as a whole.
Volume 2 is the actual internals, covering many topics that don't fit into Vol 1.
Volume 3 isn't out yet.
<p>
Volume 1 was originally sold in paper and in eBook form.
Unfortunately for Levin, a copy of the eBook was included in a large
tranche of material that WikiLeaks "obtained" from a careless CIA agent,
and the book was thus available for free across the Internet,
resulting in the author withdrawing from selling it.
The <a href="uploads/AndroidInternals-Levin.pdf">copy reproduced here</a>
is <i>included with the author's permission</i>, in hopes that a few
people who are really interested in the topic will
<a href="http://newandroidbook.com">purchase the updated Volume 1
and the new (2022) Volume 2</a> which goes into much more detail.
