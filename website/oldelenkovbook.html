<h1>Elenkov on Android</h1>
<p>
Nikolay Elenkov published the book 
<a href='https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1593275811'>Android Security Internals</a> through No Starch Press in 2015.
While the book is quite good as far as it goes, it has seen no love since 2015.
I contacted Nikolay and he assures me he is not (as of May 2022) planning any updates.
So the <a href="levinbooks.html">Levin books</a> may be a better investment.
